      <p className="text-center">
        Today June 7, 2024 marks Justin and Kailey&apos;s the first anniversary!
      </p>
      <h2 className="my-5 text-center text-2xl font-bold">How We Met</h2>
      <p>
        Justin and Kailey met as teaching assistants for CSE 121 in fall 2023.
        It was an exciting time because it was the first time the course was
        being taught. Kailey was previously taught CSE 162 teaching assistant
        and Justin previously taught CSE 142, the predecessor to CSE 121.
        Because of this, Justin had some experience with the course structure
        and was a lead for that quarter. He even gave a self introduction during
        the first Staff Meeting (though kailey doesn&apos;t remember this).
        However, their first interactions with each other were in the copy room
        of CSE2. Kailey was in the room with other TA&apos;s and the copy
        machine wasn&apos;t working. That&apos;s when Justin opened the door
        into the room.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Kailey&apos;s first impression of Justin: Tan and small head.</p>
      <p>

        forehead
      </p>

      <br />

      <p>
        After resolving the prining issue and getting their section copies, they
        began walking home. Justin lived in Savannah appartments and Kailey
        lived in Nordheim at the time. However, for some reason Kailey was
        walking up the Ave as well. This was when Justin and Kailey first
        started talking with each other.
      </p>
      <h2 className="my-5 text-center text-2xl font-bold">
        Getting Closer to Each Other
      </h2>
      <p>
        After their first fated meeting, they didn&apos;t talk much to each
        other afterwards. They would occasionally See each other during lectures
        and walk home together after meetings but nothing beyond that. During
        one of they lectures, however, Kailey gifted Justin a Blue Lock sticker
        and Pokemon charm which started Justin&apos;s long list of indebtments
        to Kailey. As the end of the quarter neared, Justin messaged Kailey
        though Instagram to remind her to apply to be a lead TA. This started
        Justin and Kailey&apos;s friendship.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Justin started playing Pikmin bloom with Kailey and quickly became
        addicted. As they grew closer Justin asked for Kailey&apos;s phone
        number since she rarely checked Instagram. On Feburary 15, 2023, Justin
        and Kailey got dinner at Mee Sum and offically became besties there.
        They grew closer and did things like watching anime, playing games,
        watching application videos, working on assingments, origami and having
        late night discord calls. They got their first meal together at
        Araya&apos;s Place for lunch.
      </p>

      <h2 className="my-5 text-center text-2xl font-bold">The Confession</h2>

      <p>
        On May 24, 2023, Justin made his decision to express his feelings
        towards Kailey. That day, Justin went over to Nordheim to play ping pong
        with Kailey before their leads meeting. It was after the leads meeting
        when Justin and Kailey stayed afterwards in the room where Justin
        prepard to stay it. Kailey came back from bathroom, sat down, closed her
        computer, and said &quot;Okay I&apos;m ready to leave&quot;. That is
        when Justin said &quot;Wait I have something to tell you...&quot;.
        However, after the confession, Kailey had conflicted feelings and she
        needed time to think about it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        What comes next was awkward since Justin and Kailey still needed to go
        print section copies. They both stood around the copy machine in silence
        as the machine slowly printed the copies and awkwardly walked home.
        However, the awkwardness didn&apos;t last long the next day they greeted
        each other between sections as Justin was preparing to leave the room.
        They played badminton and tennis a couple days later and watched more
        application videos. They quickly went back to being besties again.
      </p>

      <h2 className="my-5 text-center text-2xl font-bold">The Response</h2>

      <p>
        On June 6, 2023, Justin and Kailey hosted a review session in
        preparation for the Spring CSE 121 final. After the review session,
        Justin suggsted playing some vollyball and encouraging our good friend
        Jaden Tan before his interview to become as CSE 12X TA. Kaiely took this
        as a perfect opportunity to say her response. So on June 7, 2023, Justin
        and Kailey briefly played some vollyball before realizing how bad they
        were and how much their forearms hurt. They got dinner at Miss
        Mike&apos;s Bento & Noodles before making their way over the the CSE1
        building to meet their favorite lil person. Afterwards, they began
        walking home. Justin didn&apos;t thnk much about it at the time but
        Kailey was frantically trying to find the right time to tell Justin
        something. At the corner of the top of the hill where Justin and Kailey
        usually say bye to each other, Justin says &quot;Okay bye bye&quot; and
        Kailey urgently says &quot;Wait! My response&quot; The rest is history.
      </p>

      <h2 className="my-5 text-center text-2xl font-bold">
        Future Aspirations
      </h2>

      <p>
        Justin and Kailey grew a lot this past year. As a couple, they grew
        closer. They found new hobbies, dealt with long distance, had their
        first micro confict, met each other&apos;s parents and families. They
        also grew professionally as they both started working. However, they
        still make time for each other every week.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Going into the next year, Justin and Kailey are looking forward to
        growing more together. Justin will probably mett Kailey&apos;s mom for
        the first time in person this year as well as getting food with the Tou
        family. Justin and Kailey&apos;s families might meet each other. Justin
        and Kailey also hope to go on a trip to Japan together next year. But
        regardless of what they do, they are looking forward to more adventures
        and creating more memories together.
